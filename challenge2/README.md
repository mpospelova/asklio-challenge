Run the code with

```
python result.py
```

`result.py` returns for each header a list of lines, such that the price and amount of lines corresponds to the header. Also, each line is assigned to only one header.

`match.py` returns for each header a list of lines, such that the price and amount of lines corresponds to the header. Also, some lines are assigned to multiple headers (I implemented this solution first, as I misunderstood the problem statement. The real solution is in `result.py`)
